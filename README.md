# Infrastructure Pipelines
A way of using terraform and ansible together in a fully automated IaC way using Github-Actions. This allows scaling up and down, building and destroying Kubernetes Clusters 

I am using Hetzner Cloud but you can switch to any provider you like by modifying the terraform code. Another possibility is writing terraform code for different cloud-providers in order to remain as cloud-agnostic as possible 

[Tfstate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) file for each environment is stored in self-hosted minio-s3 storage. 
> It is recommended to use a [lock](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/locking) for your state!

# Required Github-Secrets
HCLOUD_TOKEN
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY

For [HA-cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology) you need at least 3 __stacked control-plane__ **or** decoupled __external etcd + control-plane nodes__. Thus a load-balancer is needed to expose the Kube-apiserver. At the moment this is not supported in an automated way! 

## Provision-infra.yml
This pipeline builds an enviroment based on terraform configuration. The pipeline takes __**Enviroment**__ as an argument.

## ansible.yml
This pipeline configures hosts to a fully functioning Kubernetes Cluster or Scales up by applying configurations only to the newly created and unconfigured machines. The pipeline takes __**Enviroment**__ as an argument.

The inventory file is generated by a python script dynamically following tfstate as a **single source of truth**. For highlighting the machines that ansible needs to target i used a tag __"**ansible-target**"__ in terraform's tfstate file so that i can generate a different inventory for the newly created instances. The ansible-target tags get wiped out when the machines are part of the Cluster.

## destory-infra.yml
This pipeline completely destroys an enviroment. The pipeline takes __**Enviroment**__ as an argument.
